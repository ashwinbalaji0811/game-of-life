# Game-of-Life

This is a run-of-the-mill unoptimized version of Conway's Game of Life Cellular Automata. Intended to be used as an experimental grounds for studying the nature of time and emergent phenomena, it can also be used for multiple other purposes.

This visualization tool is developed using `p5.js` Javascript Library whose source code is also added to this repository as `p5.js` file. Hence, any future non-backward compatible upgrades to the opensource `p5.js` library will not hinder this visual simulation's execution.
